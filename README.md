# LaneDetectionNet

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`our256.ipynb`) focused on lane detection using deep learning.

## 🛣️ Description

The notebook implements a custom lane detection model using PyTorch. It loads a dataset of road images, preprocesses the data, trains a convolutional neural network, and visualizes the predicted lane markings.

## ✅ Features

- PyTorch-based CNN for lane detection
- Custom dataset handling and preprocessing
- Training and evaluation loops
- Loss and accuracy tracking
- GPU acceleration (if available)
- Output visualization for detected lanes
